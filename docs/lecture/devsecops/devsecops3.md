# {{ title }}

Scaling in a company is very difficult, thus **all** parties in DevOps must increase the security. 

!!! information "Old non-DevOps structures have a ration like this"
    100 developers → 10 operators → 1 security specialist

**Shift-left** transfers the responsibility for security directly to the DevOps teams, thus DevSecOps.

!!! danger "Skills set needed"
    The right skills must be present in the DevOps team!
    
    The benefit of this is that overall **security awareness** in the team increases due to the diversity in the skills

Security roles in a large-scale company are: *Security Officer*, *Security Coach* and *Security Champion/Ambassador*. And all they build up the **Security community** for the DevSecOps approach!
