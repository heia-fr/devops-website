To resume the most important points in DevSecOps, we have:

- General awareness - training program
- Intrinsic security - make security as simple and accessible as possible
- Identity & Access management - mapping of all DevSecOps roles and having the processes
- Organization - Security is anchored in the DevSecOps organization. Responsibility for risks and vulnerabilities
- Automation, automation and, automation

**Efficient security in a DevSecOps organization is primarily characterized by the strong integration of the various security activities**. The better the individuals steps are linked, the more effectively security can be implemented. 

Thus the DevSecOps approach helps to achieve this goal.
